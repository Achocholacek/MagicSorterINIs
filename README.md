# MagicSorterINIs

I recently obtained a Magic Sorter (https://www.magic-sorter.com/) and have started to work on some custom INI's to sort Flesh and Blood cards in a way that "makes sense" to me. This is either based around alphabetical frequency of a card title (allowing you to maximize your input and minimize head movement, theoretically.), or set order stuff.

These are all just things i've slapped together/written bad code to generate, so they might suck, but in my head they make sense.
