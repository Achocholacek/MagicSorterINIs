These scripts in this folder will sort the *entire set* Alphabetically while doing two things:

1) Allowing you to use your entire first row as feeder stacks (instead of just 4)
2) Set the destinations based on the Frequency the first letter of the card name appears, starting from the front left to back right, which should allow for slightly faster sorting/less travel time. Your unknown cards will drop in the far back right corner.

Just remember, your piles will not be in alphabetical order, but frequency order.

The subfolders will apply the same logic to a single class within a set.
